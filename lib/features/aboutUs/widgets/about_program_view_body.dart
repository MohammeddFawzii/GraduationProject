              "Our sign language translator combines computer vision and machine learning techniques. It utilizes a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of sign language gestures to recognize and interpret the user's signs. The captured video input is processed in real-time to generate accurate and instantaneous translations.",

          questionAnswer:
              "We have achieved a high level of accuracy in our sign language translation. However, it's important to note that sign language is a complex and nuanced form of communication, and there might be occasional instances where the translation may not perfectly capture every subtlety. We continuously strive to improve the accuracy and reliability of our program through user feedback and ongoing development efforts.",
